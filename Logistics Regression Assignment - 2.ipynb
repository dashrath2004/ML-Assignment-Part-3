    "Grid search CV (Cross-validation) is a hyperparameter tuning method used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a machine learning algorithm that provides the best model performance. It works by systematically testing different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the combination that provides the best model performance. The grid search algorithm uses a grid of hyperparameters to explore all possible combinations of hyperparameters to find the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by specifying a range of values for each hyperparameter that needs to be tuned. The algorithm then constructs a grid of all possible combinations of hyperparameters, and it evaluates the performance of each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation. Cross-validation helps to evaluate the performance of a model by dividing the data into k-folds, where one fold is used for testing, and the remaining folds are used for training the model. The process is repeated k times, and the average performance is calculated. Finally, the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance is selected as the optimal hyperparameters for the model."

    "Data leakage can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the test set, but poorly on new, unseen data.

This can result in a model that is not useful for making predictions in the real world.\n",

If you include the customer's termination date as a feature in the training data, the model will learn that customers who terminate their service within a certain time period are more likely to churn. However, this information is not available in the test data, and including it in the training data will result in a model that overfits the training data and performs poorly on new data."
