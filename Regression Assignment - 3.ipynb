    "Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that is used when there is multicollinearity among the predictor variables. It is a regularization method that adds a penalty term to the sum of squared residuals in the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression equation. The penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients of the regression variables. The goal of ridge regression is to reduce the variance of the estimated regression coefficients by shrinking them towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ordinary least squares regression aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. OLS regression does not account for the effects of multicollinearity, and can sometimes result in overfitting of the model if there are too many predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between the two regression methods is that ridge regression adds a regularization term to the OLS equation that controls the magnitude of the regression coefficients. By adding this regularization term, ridge regression can help prevent overfitting and improve the stability of the model, especially when dealing with a large number of predictor variables."

The contribution can be evaluated by looking at the change in the mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared value. At each step, the model is updated using Ridge Regression with an appropriate value of λ to ensure that only the most important variables are included in the final model.\n",
